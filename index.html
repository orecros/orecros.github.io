  <p>
    Hey, I'm Andrew Tollett. I'm currently finishing up my bachelor's in
    Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas, to graduate
    December 2019.

    I have proven experience working with C# and Unity as well as programming in
    Lua, but i enjoy learning to use new languages and tools (Python,
    Javascript, Java, C++, Game Maker). While I find programming most interesting,
    I also greatly enjoy design and have a little experience working on almost
    every part of a game.

  <h1>Ludum Dare 41 & Level design tools - Unity C#</h1>
  <img src="rred0.gif" align="left" height="256px">
  <p>
    This is a little bit of a post-mortem I did after participating in Ludum
    Dare 41, a 48 hour game jam. (Quick gif of gameplay to the left. You can
    check out more info about that project
    <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/room-runner-extreme-deluxe">here</a>.)
    The infinite runner aspects interested me, and I wanted to try pushing it into
    the direction of a chill background game. Unfortunately I couldn't find a set of mechanics
    that satisfied me, so I started to prioritize other projects. Some of the
    work I did was to create some tools that would assist me in designing or generating levels
    for that game. Most of these tools would really be useful for any infinite runner, so I'm
    keeping them around. <br></br>

  <h2>Generating Surf Slopes and Platforms over Bezier Splines.
    <a href="https://github.com/orecros/orecros.github.io/blob/master/Source/Bunny%20Hopping%20Level%20Design%20Tools/">[Sample Source]</a></h2>
  <p>
    These tools allow a level designer to quickly block out a level chunk, and can
    even allow a level to be generated by the computer at runtime. <br></br>

    Using bezier splines proved to be a challenge when it came to evenly spacing
    blocks (and slope segments) along the curve. Even within a single curve,
    a fractional amount along the parametric curve was not guaranteed to be the same
    length. Bezier curves, however, are <em>much</em> nicer for the designer to play
    with as it allows for less segments to cover the same path, and nice gradual curves
    with no noticeable cusps. The solution was to, upon generation of the curve or block pile,
    create a poly line along the bezier curve by connecting points fractionally placed
    along the curve. While these line segments weren't necessarily the same length, finding
    the length of each segment was trivial, as was lerping between two points to get a good
    approximation of the bezier curve.<br>

    This method worked great for the block placer, but the segments for the surf
    slope actually benefitted from being condensed at sharp corners, so it was
    changed to only use bezier splines.<br></br>

  <h2> Linked regions with poisson-disc sampling
    <a href="https://github.com/orecros/orecros.github.io/blob/master/Source/Poisson/BlockRegion.cs">[Sample Source]</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    For this infinite runner, map chunks are generated one at a time ahead of the
    player. Each chunk is filled with platforms that should be homogenously spaced,
    even across adjacent chunks. Simply using poisson-disc sampling separately for
    each chunk leads to obvious gaps or seams between the chunks. <br></br>

    The solution was to, whenever blocks were to be generated, seed the generator
    with the positions of blocks from adjacent chunks. First, the positions of all
    the old blocks are converted to the same coordinate system as the generator.
    Blocks from old chunks that were not close enough to the new chunk to have any
    effect are culled from the list, and the remainder are added as seeds. seeds are
    tracked separately from newly generated blocks to prevent duplicate blocks from
    being generated.<br></br>

    In the figure displayed, 4 chunks are generated adjacent to each other and then
    populated with blocks in order. The green arrows are drawn between two blocks
    generated within the same chunk as they were generated by the algorithm. Red
    arrows are drawn across the gaps, with the starting point blocks being seeds
    in the new chunk.<br></br>

  <h1>Halloween Run - Game Design Document</h1>
  <img src="halloweenrun.png" align="right" height="512px">
  <p>
    This is a game design document I wrote. <a href="Halloweenrun.html">you can access it here</a>. here's
    the introduction from the document:<br></br>

    <em>Halloween-run</em> is a first or third-person shooter for PC about using bizarre
    weapons and tools to survive the oncoming horde of halloween monsters. As the
    player survives, the procedurally generated neighborhood and its denizens slowly
    become more and more frightening: Trees grow faces. tombstones sprout up from
    empty lots. Eldritch tentacles sprout from the earth. Witches and werewolves are
    replaced by pale walking corpses and frozen giants. Will you live long enough to
    find the door back out to reality?<br></br>

    The image to the right gives a brief rundown of the procedural generation
    system. Most procedural generation is made to build an area a player will
    quickly run through once. My challenge in doing procedural generation for a
    rather small area that the player will play possibly multiple 20-minute
    games in is to create an area that can be learned and remembered but still
    be within the constraints of easy generation. <br></br>

    In addition to being procedurally generated, I plan to have the level slowly
    "corrupt" over the course of a game, giving birth to new stage hazards, new
    enemies, and a darker tone.

    <strong>This is a fork</strong> of a popular, decade old garry's mod gamemode
    called Zombie Survival. I lead a team of 3 through 2 2-month development
    cycles, with 1 more planned cycle to be completed summer 2019. <br></br>

    In Broad Strokes, classic zombie survival was about utilizing scarce
    resources to survive 6 waves against the undead, mostly through running,
    hiding, barricading, and killing. Modern zombie survival has become bloated
    with legacy features to the point of it almost being unrecognizeable, with
    a heavier focus on team tactics and barricading.<br></br>

    Most key components of the game have been modified to combine the run-and-gun
    action of the old 2011-era Zombie Survival with some of the more modern
    developments of recent patches. <br></br>

    Some sample Lua source code <a href="https://github.com/orecros/orecros.github.io/tree/master/Source/Tropical%20Zombie%20Survival">is available here</a><br>
    A more complete description of our changes <a href="TZS.html">is available here</a><br>
    "Zombie survival" was originally created by William Moodhe in 2006 <a href="https://github.com/JetBoom/zombiesurvival">[github]</a><br>

    Tile Snake was my entry to ludum dare #35, a 48 hour game jam. It's a turn-based
    puzzle game that combines mechanics from push block puzzles with snake.
