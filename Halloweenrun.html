class="c18">Halloween-run</span><span>&nbsp;is a first or third-person shooter for PC about using bizarre weapons and tools to survive the oncoming horde of halloween monsters. As the player survives, the procedurally generated neighborhood and its denizens slowly become more and more frightening: Trees grow faces. tombstones sprout up from empty lots. Eldritch tentacles sprout from the earth. Witches and werewolves are replaced by pale walking corpses and frozen giants. Will you live long enough to find the door back out to reality?</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.tsbkw1m68lu8"><span class="c10">Genre / Target Audience</span></h1><p class="c2"><span>First-Person-Shooter Action-Arcade </span><span class="c3">Roguelite.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The target audience is the Action-Roguelite crowd (Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon, Nuclear Throne, etc), and the generic FPS crowd.</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.s1ulkjl93psd"><span>Story</span></h1><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Dog&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kitty&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Snowball&rdquo; are </span><span class="c3">too old to go trick-or-treating, but go anyway. As a result, they get sucked into Hell. the only way out is to prove their resolve, prowess with firearms, and true halloween spirit in an all-out battle against halloween&rsquo;s finest: ghouls, goblins, witches and zombies, vampires, werewolves, mummies and more.</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.dokizyc0wtpy"><span class="c10">Characters</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The player has the choice between several characters before a game begins. Each character has a few unique features that inform their playstyle, and have weapon and equipment drops weighted towards that playstyle. Each character has a single active ability. Character choice secretly correlates with difficulty to some degree, with dog being the easiest for new players, and snowball being the hardest. While stats are tracked per character, unlockable equipment and weapons transfer between them. Dog, Kitty, and Snowball are planned launch characters, with additional characters maybe being added later.</span></p><h2 class="c20" id="h.vn556o1b1jle"><span class="c19">Dog</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Dog is the easy-to-play character for new players. Dog has the ability to passively sniff out items and tough enemies and can see them through walls if they are nearby. Dog&rsquo;s active ability is sprint: He moves with increased speed but cannot attack. If he takes melee damage from an enemy, he will bite them back for a large chunk of damage, usually enough to kill weaker enemies in one hit.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Dog don&rsquo;t talk much. His friends joked that he already looked enough like a lumberjack that he could just leave the house in his normal clothes and people would think he was in costume. They didn&rsquo;t expect him to actually do it. He&rsquo;s burley, red bearded, and grim. He really does look like a lumberjack with his plaid shirt, ripped blue jeans and black beanie.</span></p><h2 class="c20" id="h.ix9l1vj5jcs4"><span>Kitty</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Kitty&rsquo;s passive ability gives her a smaller detection radius, causing enemies to lose interest in her at a closer distance than normal. Kitty&rsquo;s active ability is stealth, allowing her to drop aggro from most enemies for a few seconds while she maneuvers to a new position. After taking damage, Kitty is granted a short burst of speed.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Kitty doesn&rsquo;t really know why she&rsquo;s here. her friends dragged her out trick or treating. What Kitty won&rsquo;t admit is that she actually really wanted to go. She&rsquo;s dressed as a cat, or whatever. Like, a witch&rsquo;s cat. A black leather jacket with black jeans, and a black cat ear headband tying back her straight, short cropped hair that she&rsquo;s almost too embarrassed to actually wear.</span></p><h2 class="c20" id="h.s9gz3m2nwp9o"><span class="c19">Snowball</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Snowball is a tough-to-learn character for veteran players. Her passive ability </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Poor Snowball is still a little kid at heart. She&rsquo;s the one that dragged everyone out here in the first place. she was staring wide-eyed at all the halloween costumes, and now is staring at the monsters with the same stupid grin on her face. Her long blond hair tumbles out of the face hole in her store-bought, one-piece sexy bunny costume. </span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.91n4nw3y3rag"><span class="c10">Levels / Environment Design</span></h1><p class="c2"><span>Plan to use procedurally generated levels.

Features are populated at world generation by being replaced with a random prefab (Populant) from a table of possible Populants. Populants can contain further Features, so these will be recursively replaced until there are no more Features. for example, a </span><span class="c14">NeighborhoodBlock </span><span>has a Populant that is 4 </span><span class="c14">HousePlot </span><span>Features separated by short picket fences. each </span><span class="c14">HousePlot </span><span class="c3">feature is then recursively populated as well. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A Feature&rsquo;s Populants are weighted by lots at an integer value &gt;=1. a Populant with a weight of 2 is twice as likely to get picked as a Populant of weight 1. Populants can also be set to have a per-level maximum count. after being picked up to their maximum amount, they can no longer be picked. A Feature is required to have at least 1 unlimited-count Populant.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Features can also have &ldquo;high priority&rdquo; populants, which must be selected before any other populant is selected. Features can also be given an empty populant to give a particular feature a chance to not exist. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">As Populants are placed, the seeder seeds those populants with additional objects using guess-and-check object placement. Populants are marked to contain a certain amount of a specific object (though this is only the amount of place attempts that will be made, not the amount that will actually be placed). these objects can also be features. This is useful for placing objects more organically such as cars randomly along roads, trees in parks, or supply spawns around. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Populants can contain features, but they also contain additional objects and information. A populant always contains a reference to what feature it was spawned from. Each populant is also seeded with possible supply spawns, which are added to a table for easy spawning later.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Due to the mechanics of high priority populants, to maintain appropriately varied layouts, features must be populated randomly instead of in some obvious order. This is done by simply selecting a random unpopulated feature from a table of remaining features.</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.afidh75suzi8"><span class="c10">Gameplay and Key Features</span></h1><h2 class="c20" id="h.fgwae1d2ts2m"><span class="c19">Gameplay</span></h2><h3 class="c5" id="h.6votpy1t6nvj"><span class="c12">Normal Mode</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The player picks their character and the game begins at sunset before &ldquo;Night 1&rdquo;. there are 6 nights and each night is 4 minutes long. The player must survive the duration of the night while killing enemies, scrounging for ammo and bandages, and racking up points which will unlock further upgrades to let the player survive further nights. Loot spawns, and enemies appear through their various methods (zombies and skeletons crawl up from the ground, giant spiders crawl out of nests, witches fly in from off the map, huge enemies jump in from off the map, etc). </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">At the end of the night, the sun rises and all the enemies have a second wind before they burn to death in the sunlight. after a tiny (~10s) break, the sun begins to set again.

A healthy player should be able to live a close encounter with most enemies, but an unhealthy one should 100% die. if you let enemies get close to you, you&rsquo;ve already made a mistake.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The Player&rsquo;s movement should be tight all around. The player should be able to stop and turn on a dime to evade their enemies. The Player&rsquo;s jump is quite powerful and allows them to get on top of many obstacles to temporarily escape monsters.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.qqft42en8wf3"><span class="c12">Consumables</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c3">consumables are loot-type items, which means they spawn around the map every wave. These are items that are highly limited in supply, but very useful. As they go into weapon slots, the player needs to consider whether or not they want to pick them up. examples include adrenaline shots, molotov cocktails, and proximity mines. note that consumables DON&rsquo;T include bandages, which go in their own slot</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.3luyxid56lhg"><span class="c12">Pickups</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c3">These are loot-type items, which means they spawn around the map every wave. These items don&rsquo;t take up weapon slots, so the player should pick them up just by running through them. Bandages take a second to apply, but instantly restore 15 health. bandages have their own hotkey to use them. Ammo boxes resupply 1 &ldquo;box&rdquo; of ammo to each weapon in your inventory, and 2 &ldquo;boxes&rdquo; to the weapon the player has equipped when they walk over it.</span></p><h2 class="c20" id="h.nkaxjgftlh7"><span class="c19">Level Corruption</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">As the player completes waves, the level will become more and more spooky, chaotic, and evil. The player should be allowed to watch this transformation occur. While seeing the level transform gradually is more thematically interesting, watching the level transform all at once is more fun to watch, so a balance needs to be struck. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The level corrupts twice, at points evenly placed within the game time. the initial level is a slightly spooky suburban neighborhood on halloween night. the second stage makes the level more dreamlike and comical in its halloween-ness. trees grow faces and hands, open lots sprout tombstones, and some plants lose their leaves. The third stage makes the level nightmarish and lovecraftian. Houses become ruins, plants wither away, and huge tendrils tear through the earth. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">As a level becomes more corrupted, it should be a more uncomfortable environment to move in. Breaking line-of-sight with enemies should be harder. There should be less verticality to the level to restrict the player&rsquo;s ability to escape melee enemies. There should be less places where the player can stand still for a moment. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Some steps that helps makes this happen: Make foliage lose its leaves, and have foliage without leaves not have collision across the board. Replace benign objects (trees, houses, empty lots) with more dangerous counterparts (living trees, haunted houses, graveyards). </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Level corruption events are calculated when a level is generated, so it should easily tie in with the Feature-Populant system. existing populants are dramatically converted to new populants, the level is pre-seeded with tendril spawn points, etc.</span></p><h2 class="c20" id="h.gfno18k168dw"><span>Weapons and modifiers</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Weapons are broken up into different weapon bases, for instance &ldquo;Revolver&rdquo; &ldquo;Handgun&rdquo; &ldquo;Hunting Shotgun&rdquo; &ldquo;Combat Shotgun&rdquo;, etc. weapons can have 0 or more &ldquo;Modifiers&rdquo;. Modifiers add additional properties to weapon bases, and are interchangeable between most, if not all bases, and should be stackable with most, if not all other modifiers.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Bases are grouped into 5 different &ldquo;rarity&rdquo; tiers. early weapon choices are skewed to more often be less rare weapons, while later weapon choices are a more even split. rarer weapons are more powerful.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">to make up for this different, weapons that aren&rsquo;t rare enough for the tier they spawn in are always given an modifier, and every weapon has an additional change to receive an modifier. this means towards the middle of the game, you might be lucky and get a very rare weapon, or a decently rare weapon with an modifier. by lategame, most weapons are guaranteed to have at least one modifier, but rarely you&rsquo;ll get the chance to use a max rarity weapon with an modifier.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Weapons should be balanced such that 2 rarity tiers is about equal to the power increase from the average modifier.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Each individual weapon has its own ammo supply. Even if you have two revolvers, their ammo supply is counted and handled seperately.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The player receives a weapon upgrade at certain point totals (points earned by killing monsters). a weapon upgrade consists of a list of 3 generated weapons and trinkets, prompting the player to choose one of those three. The player also has the choice to skip a tier for extra points.</span></p><h2 class="c20" id="h.gpuqi1mqb6is"><span class="c19">Enemies</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">A level should feel like it&rsquo;s thick with enemies in every direction. The only safe space should appear to be &ldquo;anywhere but here&rdquo;. The player should be empowered with the ability to escape, but should feel like attempts to kill enemies </span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.c0gx2h5a0u04"><span class="c12">Enemies and Corruption</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c3">As the level becomes more corrupted, so to do the enemies.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The first stage should be easily recognizable villains: &ldquo;Bad guy everyone knows&rdquo;. The goal is for these enemies to, while maintaining a spooky feel, feel familiar to the player (specifically a player who is just slightly submerged in western culture). Vampires, Werewolves, Witches, Zombies, Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster, The Headless Horseman.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The second stage should be enemies that are more scary, and less cliche: The half of castlevania enemies that don&rsquo;t have a popular B-movie for them. The player shouldn&rsquo;t really be surprised by the addition of any of these enemies, but they shouldn&rsquo;t be all the obvious inclusions either. Empty suits of armor, Skeletal warriors, Wraiths, Living trees, Giant Spiders, Giant Wasps. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The third stage should be completely foreign and terrifying enemies: enemies that play with the fear of the unknown, like most enemies in bloodborne. Twisted, blackened shapes with protruding bones, hunched figures covered in maggots, Malformed titans made of stone and ice, muscled men covered in eyes, giant tentacles built of human muscle. </span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.py8kapasp52b"><span>Enemy Subtypes</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c3">While each enemy should be unique in some aspect, these enemies do fall into a few subtypes as enumerated below</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Fodder: These enemies chase the player in packs. They aren&rsquo;t smart enough to climb up things to chase the player. the player should outrun them, but if they waste time they&rsquo;ll find the pack right behind them. This enemy should keep the player moving and fill out the environment with a constant threat. Zombies, Skeletons, and Charples</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Chaser: These enemies are grounded, but move fast and can climb up onto objects that even the player can&rsquo;t. The player should be forced to react to chasers quickly or take a lot of damage. While fodder keep the player moving, chasers keep the player attentive. Werewolves, Giant spiders, Tar-eyes</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Tank: These enemies should be BIG. they can&rsquo;t fit into most areas, and move slowly. While they can be killed, it&rsquo;s usually a waste of good bullets. They should break up a player&rsquo;s routing and shove them off into a direction they didn&rsquo;t want to go in. Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster, Really Giant Spiders, Frost Giants.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Flying: These enemies control the skies and can easily follow the player anywhere, but don&rsquo;t. If a flying enemy happens to be next to the player, they will attack the player, but are mostly, like the tank, a tool to keep the player from using the same route too much, and keep them from abusing verticality too hard: Witches, Flying wasps, winged amalgams.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.ejxuggrww5mn"><span class="c12">AI and Pathfinding</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Enemies will cover a wide array of sizes, shapes, and movement patterns, therefore the AI pathfinding system must be robust enough to consider different enemy types which can&rsquo;t fit through specific holes, some that can and can&rsquo;t jump up certain heights, and some that aren&rsquo;t constrained to the ground at all. On top of this, the corruption of the environment means the navmesh is going to go through slight changes twice over the course of the ~25 minute game time. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The stock unity navmesh system does not support this, but they are supported by unity-built </span><span class="c11"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/NavMesh-BuildingComponents.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1551757795974000">tools external to stock unity</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">these tools support different agent types. making Off-Mesh links exclusive to certain enemy types is possible through the NavMesh Link object. making different areas impassable by different enemy types is possible through NavMesh Modifiers and NavMesh Modifier Volumes. combined with obstacles, enabling / creating game objects with these tools attached to them during corruption events and then updating the navmesh can allow for easy changes to the navmesh. I&rsquo;m unsure at this second if updating the navmesh would regenerate the navmesh, which would be expensive, or just update some values at the already generated navmesh points, which would be cheap.</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.63ghg14m65qt"><span>Art / Concepts</span></h1><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 457.60px; height: 773.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 457.60px; height: 773.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The art will be be low-fidelity and mostly devoid of textures. While at the beginning, the level will mostly reflect a peaceful, mid-halloween suburban neighborhood, over time it should slowly devolve, through various means controlled by gameplay, into a more sinister, alien, and mature environment, while still attempting to keep the semblance of a lighthearted tone. none of the visceral, fleshy look of deadspace&rsquo;s corrupted areas, but some of the mood that those convey.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 382.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 382.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">On the left we have the sort of cartoon-y halloween villains that should populate the beginning of the game, and on the right we have more of the nightmarish enemies that should populate the end of the game. This art doesn&rsquo;t reflect the target artstyle, just the difference in enemy design</span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.y40286raj1df"><span class="c10">Sound and Music</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Most sound effects (shotgun blasts, zombie moans, witch zaps, etc) can just use stock sound effects. No reason to go crazy there.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">In between waves, there should be some ambient effects based on the corruption level. crickets and frogs for stage 1, distant zombie moans and creaking branches for stage 2, distant chanting and the blood rushing in the player&rsquo;s ears for stage 3</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">In between waves the same subdued, quiet track should play, but it should be on the major scale for the first stage, the minor scale for the second, and should either be modal and dissonant for stage 3 or completely nonexistent.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">In addition to the in-between-waves track, there should be a single main menu track, as well as 3 wave-in-progress tracks, one for each stage. these shouldn&rsquo;t be the same song changed each time, but should still line up with the mood of each stage.</span></p><h2 class="c20" id="h.jank6nvwg1b5"><span class="c19">Priority of enemy sounds</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Some enemies should have more distinct sound effects than others. This isn&rsquo;t some sort of hierarchy of whose sound effect plays as much as it is a guideline to the auditory footprint a sound should have. This mostly lines up with how dangerous the enemies are, but not exactly</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The lowest priority enemies are fodder, as there are going to be dozens of them on the map at any one time. their sound effects should be the least distracting</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">next should be any sneaky enemy. Any type of enemy that attempts to attack the player just as the walk around a corner. These types of enemies should still have some sort of auditory cue the player should strain to listen for to tell if the are about to be attacked, as well as a very high priority sound effect as the are attacking you</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">next should be any really big enemy. These guys are very obvious visually, so there&rsquo;s no real reason why their sound effects should be distracting.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">next should be chasers. these enemies try to run at the player as quickly as possible, so should be really distracting auditorily.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">finally, the most distracting sounds should be flying enemies. These enemies are fast, and will spend a large portion of their lifetime off the player&rsquo;s camera. While a flying enemy is close enough to attack you, you should be perfectly aware that it is there, and also in what direction of you it is in.</span></p></body></html>
