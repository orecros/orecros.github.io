ZS has been a playable gamemode since as early as 2007, developed, up until extremely recently, by William &ldquo;JetBoom&rdquo; Moodhe. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Tropical Zombie Survival</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a modification of this gamemode meant to combine the fast-paced run-and-gun gameplay from early additions of ZS with the general systems and quality-of-life upgrades that exist in more modern versions of ZS. </span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.lvnwna50izm9"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Modern&rdquo; Zombie Survival</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c6">ZS</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a simple PVP game between two teams: Humans and Zombies. While zombies have infinite lives to spend killing humans, humans only have one life each. after death, a human joins the zombie team. When all the humans are dead or the time limit expires, all the zombies lose and any remaining humans win. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three most iconic features of ZS are the human&rsquo;s ability to use the Source Engine&rsquo;s physics based props to barricade against the zombies, the most valuable human players unlocking more powerful weapons and equipment, and a class system for the zombie team. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Modern ZS emphasizes strategic gameplay from the human and zombie teams. Experienced players direct their respective teams to attack and defend several barricades laid out across the map, in order to gain or keep control over 3 powerful Sigils that strengthen the team that controls them. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This barricade-focused gameplay is exciting in certain aspects, especially for the experienced players who are making the decisions, but the rather boring gruntwork, paired with many &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; moments leave newer players frustrated, stuck in front of the same barricade for a mind numbing 35 minute round time (most gamemodes for garry&rsquo;s mod have 5-10 minute round times. dead players for most gamemodes simply spectate and wait for the next round to start).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After over 10 years of development, modern ZS suffers from rampant feature-creep. with over 250 weapons, dozens of trinkets, deployables, and other tools, a crafting system and even a skill tree, new players are often left overwhelmed with options. Options where over half of the choices are so sub-optimal that playing with them is a detriment to the player&rsquo;s enjoyment.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.x8203dp26ujo"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oldschool&rdquo; Zombie Survival</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the era of 2011 zombie survival, there were less tools to allow humans to construct powerful barricades, and no Sigils or other deployables to incentivize players to stay in one plays. Redemption, a process that allowed more skilled zombie players to be returned to the human team, allowed for more fluidity between the two teams. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Old-school ZS is played with a feeling of &ldquo;every man for himself&rdquo;. While humans may have a better chance sticking together, powerful zombie classes and unexpected complications lead more often to betrayal, chaos, and hilarity. While barricading was a powerful tool for the human team, it wasn&rsquo;t the only tool on the human&rsquo;s belt. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While the vibe of Old-school feels fresh 7 years later, the frustratingly long 40 minute round times, poorly designed maps, and general rough edges make it hard to stomach. Pair that with any lack of meaningful progression other than stats, and you have a killer combo of anti-fun. </span></p><h1 class="c4" id="h.ukmf5vs38q9d"><span class="c10">Tropical Zombie Survival</span></h1><p class="c1"><span>Tropical zombie survival is the gamemode that combines the good from the old and new versions of zombie survival. Starting with the latest release of zombie survival on </span><span class="c8"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/JetBoom/zombiesurvival/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1543636525948000">github</a></span><span class="c0">, Team Tropical has made extensive changes to the game that brings it more inline with the swashbuckling action of Old-School. </span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.j7glpzlm522d"><span class="c3">Weapon Upgrade System</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Old-school ZS used a simple system of upgrades: a human&rsquo;s score is equal to the amount of kills they have. once they reach a certain checkpoint (ranging from 5 to 45 kills), they receive a random upgrade from a table of possible upgrades. This means by the end of the game, the best players have a massive arsenal of different weapons that are good for different situations, while everyone else who is just hanging on at least has 3 weapons to choose from. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, score being the same as kills leads to gameplay that unevenly favors weapons with higher damage per shot over damage per round, and encourages kill stealing. additionally, every zombie type is worth the same amount, so weaker faster zombies can feed humans into having powerful weaponry at way earlier stages of the game without costing them much in terms of ammunition. In addition, the absolute randomness of the weapons the player received leads to varied gameplay, but also omits a little bit of strategy that is well missed on the human team.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Modern ZS uses a point system. different zombies are worth different amounts of points. the points are split evenly between players based on damage dealt. While weapons are still priced over a massive range (25-500 points), points can only be spent once. If the player opts to buy a lower cost, less powerful weapon, it means a delay in the purchase of a more powerful weapon. this narrows the optimal player&rsquo;s arsenal to being only 1 or 2 guns by the end of the game, a much less exciting experience. in addition, points can be spent to unlock additional equipment, but, again, the optimal player won&rsquo;t buy the additional equipment, knowing that their less talented teammates will be forced to spend their few points on them in order to help the humans win.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tropical ZS combines the best of these two features. More fair point spreading through modern ZS&rsquo;s point system, but weapon upgrades are tied to certain score checkpoints (ranging from 25-300). weapon upgrades also allow the player to pick from 3 possibilities pulled from a potentially much greater pool. This limits the choices for new players without reducing the variety for the old ones. earning points also earns the player Scrap simultaneously. Scrap can be spent in the scrap shop to buy situational items like medical supplies, impulse grenades, and teleporters. There are NO weapons in the scrap shop, to help incentivize all players to mix firepower with utility.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.l45vk6nt1t6t"><span class="c3">Shopping, Ammo Resupplies, Health.</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oldschool ZS does not have a shop of any type. Upgrades are granted as soon as the player hits the threshold. Ammo resupply is passive, awarding the player with extra ammo for their currently held weapon. Ammo regeneration is extremely limiting, forcing players to conserve ammo, and adds value to weapons that are more efficient uses of that ammo. missing ammo resupply periods because you accidentally held out the wrong weapon is frustrating, though. The game is almost completely devoid of health. 1 in every 3 maps may contain a refilling health station, but without a health station on the map, players have no guaranteed healing, having a chance to heal at 10 kills and 45 kills based on the random unlock. Any damage a zombie does to a human sticks for a long time. This forces humans to be careful, but is all in all a little too punishing, especially considering how easy it is to take small amounts of damage from fast moving zombie classes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Modern ZS has all shopping done through an arsenal crate, or a sigil. arsenal crates are objects owned by a player that they place somewhere on the map. a player who wants a gun must find an arsenal crate (or sigil) in order to purchase anything (Sigils serving as shops is a recent change, more recent than the inception of Tropical ZS. before this change, if the last arsenal crate on the map was broken, the human team basically couldn&rsquo;t win, and the next 10 minutes were a waste of time as zombies waited for humans to run out of ammo). Ammo resupply is handled by a separate deployable known as the resupply crate. the player can additionally override what ammo type they get from the resupply through a context menu. Ammo can also be purchased at will very cheaply from the arsenal crate. most weapons will return more points than were spent on the ammo, allowing players to fire pretty much indiscriminately. Health is also unnecessarily plentiful. Humans are also awarded points for healing their teammates. depending on the patch, healing teammates can even be more lucrative than shooting zombies. Any damage a zombie deals in one life will usually be healed up before that zombie even respawns again, leading to huge frustrating moments for the entire zombie team. combined with plentiful ammo, spawn camping is rampant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tropical ZS has no set item to unlock upgrades or use the shop. Ammo resupply is regenerative like in Old-School, but tropical inherited the ability to override your next ammo supply type from modern ZS. There is no ammo available in shops to return value to the little ammo players do get. Players who get enough points receive access to medical supplies in the shop, and everyone else receives some healing at the end of every wave. this, combined with zombies now burning up in holy fire between waves makes intermission a smaller goal for humans to reach over the course of the 25 minute game.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.4b4d772yhpp"><span class="c3">Zombie Class System</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Old-school ZS has 9 classes. more powerful classes are unlocked as the waves continue, leaving less powerful classes still available to be chosen. even though later classes are more powerful than earlier classes, some classes which fill a niche never get a more powerful version, and the classes that do get a more powerful version are still left on the class select list just to trick new players.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Modern ZS has 12 classes available at any one time, replacing weak classes with more powerful recolors as the waves continue. It also introduces boss and mini-boss zombies. at the start of each wave, the MVP zombie for the last round is chosen to play a very powerful boss zombie from a list of 12 possible choices, and the next 2-5 runner ups depending on server population are picked as miniboss classes. minibosses aren&rsquo;t actually that much better than regular classes, and are even less diverse in terms of archetypes. (This is an aspect that is currently rapidly evolving in modern ZS even as we develop tropical, but at Tropical&rsquo;s inception it was an issue). Boss choice is a very important aspect of the strategic gameplay of modern ZS.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tropical ZS ditches most of the bloat of modern ZS classes. currently there are 8 regular classes, 9 miniboss classes, and 4 bosses. Removed classes were mostly slight variations of other classes that made no significant change to the gameplay. While boss zombies are still always given to the MVP, miniboss classes are occasionally random, allowing any player to experience a little more of the game, The 4 boss classes in the game are very different from eachother, and all perform massively different tasks. Game warping classes that force players to stay in a barricade or die were either promoted from regular to miniboss or completely removed from the game. minibosses and bosses are designed to create high moments of gameplay for both the zombie playing the class and humans playing against it, without making regular zombie classes feel completely useless.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.gmkx6uai44k4"><span class="c3">The Skill Tree / Perk System</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Old-school has no skill tree or per system</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Modern ZS features a skill tree that directly increases the power of players who have more hours on the server. perks are either as worthless as +1% HP, -1% speed or incredibly game warping. the skill tree features the Remort system that allows players to start over again from level 1 but be slightly more powerful at max level.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The perk system for tropical ZS isn&rsquo;t yet implemented, but the plan is to make a &ldquo;Perk Loadout&rdquo; system. A new player starts with 25 slots that can be filled with perks, and they start filled with perks that are most beneficial for new players. a perkless human is less powerful than an old-school human: they lack many of the special abilities modern ZS humans have, but those instead fill the default perk loadout, leaving the player almost unchanged, except for a few features that favor new players: specifically, the removal of backpedaling speed reduction, where players move slower if they walk straight backwards, wave-end healing, the ability to pass through teammate&rsquo;s barricades, and extra ammo generation. experienced players can swap these out, along with perks that increase max HP, scrap generation, and speed, for more interesting perks that help vary gameplay. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.7hleym7z584h"><span class="c3">Quick Numbers</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are features and refactors that mostly don&rsquo;t have analogs in oldschool or modern ZS, and are mostly written out here so this is a more complete collection of the work done for tropical ZS.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Human weapon choices are down from &gt;200 to 35. of which 7 are completely new, and 17 have been significantly reworked with either massive balance changes, new abilities, or both. The large weapon variety actually hurt the design space for weapons. weapons are now mostly sorted by ammo type so that different ammo types are differently valuable in terms of raw firepower versus how much of it you get. This is also mentioned later on, but of those 200 weapons, half of them are completely worthless at any given time due to how hard it is to balance 200 unique weapons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Planned weapon count should hit about 50 at critical mass. going to likely steal the vaulting system from Fortnite (occasionally swap guns, zombie classes, and features) in and out of the game to keep it feeling fresh. with the vault adding back some crowd favorites from modern ZS, We still would likely max out at about 80 weapons, with still a max at 50 playable at any one time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of the 19 zombie classes currently available to be played, 8 are completely new, and 5 have been significantly reworked with massive balance changes, new abilities, or both. Additionally, all zombies use a unified base for their weaponry and other class features, something that isn&rsquo;t part of the released modern ZS.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Status effects Bleed and poison have been given their own identities instead of being 2 different names for damage over time. additionally, all slows have been unified into one stacking status effect known as &ldquo;cripple&rdquo;, and a 3rd damage over time &ldquo;Radiation&rdquo; has been added. </span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_qw4k20p2shtk-0 start"><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c0">bleed is fast, but is easily cured. players quick on the uptake will mitigate huge amounts of bleed damage with a well timed heals</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c0">poison is incredibly slow, and only stacks up to 25. poison is mostly used for chip damage, and if the player is already almost at 25 stacks, additional chip damage is essentially curved off. this way, zombie classes that throw poison are more useful if they are utilized rarely, instead of spammed</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c0">Radiation is a special damage type exclusive to the nuclear zombie and the blood bag. radiation damage applies faster the more of it you have stacked on you, and is pretty easy to cure. Radiation is used to cull off humans if the zombie-to-human ratio is disproportionate. too many humans means not enough healing to go around, which means more people die and the teams balance out.</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tropical ZS features new GUI for the zombie class select, human shop and human upgrade menus. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
